* Months with higher WFH show slightly reduced physical attendance, without impacting availability
* April month had highest attendance and least SL%.

## 💡 Business Recommendations

* Adopt a structured hybrid model (2 days WFH + 3 days office)
* Encourage office presence on Tuesday–Wednesday for collaboration
* Team-building activities on high-attendance mid-week days to maximize participation
